    <ul>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1tbs butter</li>
        <li>2tbs cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Method</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt butter in a frying pan over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Gently mix eggs and cream in a bowl</li>
        <li>Once butter has melted add cream add cream and eggs</li>
        <li>Using a spatula fold the eggs from the edge of the pan to the center every 20 seconds(as if you are making an omlette)</li>
        <li>When the eggs are still moist remove from the heat (it will continue to cook on the plate until served)</li>
